    "**How does court surface (Hard, Clay, Grass) affect (1) upset probability and (2) the predictive power of player rankings in professional tennis matches?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will examine:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whether the probability of an upset (lower-ranked player defeating higher-ranked player) differs significantly across surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whether ranking difference predicts match outcomes equally well on all surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key variables** include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Surface (categorical)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rank_1, Rank_2 (used to compute ranking difference)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Winner (binary outcome)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Odds (used as a secondary comparison baseline)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Controls**\n",
    "* **Tournament Type** (Grand Slams, Masters 1000, ATP 500/250) this will help isolate whether upsets are caused by court surface itself or differing levels of pressure and player motivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Match Format** (Best of 3 vs Best of 5) because Grand Slams hold best-of-5 matches and standard ATP matches are best-of-3 we will be using \"best of\" as a control variable, accounting for longer matches typically reducing the probability of an upsets by allowing a higher level player more time to recover from a slow start.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project combines statistical inference (testing differences in upset rates across surfaces) with a prediction task (logistic regression models estimating match outcomes from ranking differences, with and without surface information). Model performance metrics such as accuracy and AUC will be used to quantify how much predictive power surface adds.\n"

    "Professional tennis is played across multiple court surfaces—primarily hard, clay, and grass—and these surfaces materially change how matches unfold. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) formalizes these differences through its *Court Pace Rating* system, which classifies surfaces based on measured ball speed and bounce characteristics. These classifications reflect meaningful physical differences in gameplay, such as rally length and serve effectiveness, and provide an official basis for treating surface as a structural variable in match outcomes.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sports science research supports the idea that surface type alters match dynamics. A recent large-scale match analysis study found statistically significant differences in rally structure, point duration, and serve impact across clay, grass, and hard courts, demonstrating that player performance profiles shift depending on surface conditions.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) These findings suggest that competitive balance may vary by surface, motivating investigation into whether certain environments produce greater outcome variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a predictive modeling perspective, Klaassen and Magnus introduced probabilistic approaches for forecasting tennis match winners, showing that match outcomes can be effectively modeled using player performance indicators.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Their work provides a foundation for treating tennis outcomes as a statistical inference and prediction task, although it does not explicitly focus on surface-specific effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "More directly related to our project goals, Kovalchik evaluated multiple tennis prediction methods and demonstrated that model accuracy depends strongly on how player strength is represented, highlighting limitations of relying on a single global ranking signal.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) This motivates examining whether ranking differences carry equal predictive meaning across different surfaces, rather than assuming rankings summarize player ability uniformly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applied analytics platforms have operationalized this idea through surface-aware rating systems. Tennis Abstract maintains separate Elo ratings for hard, clay, and grass courts and reports improved forecasting performance compared to a single universal rating.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) Additionally, Tennis Abstract has shown that match predictability varies by surface, with some surfaces consistently producing higher variance outcomes.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6) These findings align closely with our project’s focus on comparing upset rates and ranking predictability across surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on this prior work, our project integrates descriptive statistics and interpretable modeling to examine (1) whether upset probabilities differ by surface and (2) whether player ranking differences predict match outcomes equally well across environments. Unlike many existing analyses that emphasize either descriptive trends or pure prediction, we aim to combine statistical testing with model-based evaluation to better understand how surface mediates competitive structure in professional tennis.\n",

    "We hypothesize that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Upset rates will be significantly higher on clay courts than on hard or grass courts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ranking difference will be less predictive of match outcomes on clay compared to hard and grass surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our reasoning is that clay courts slow down play and reduce the advantage of powerful serves, allowing lower-ranked players to remain competitive through longer rallies and defensive consistency. This should increase variance in outcomes and weaken the predictive signal of rankings. Conversely, grass and hard courts are expected to amplify skill and power differences, making rankings more informative predictors."
